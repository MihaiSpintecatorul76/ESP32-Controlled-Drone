# ESP32 Drone

## Project Overview
This project is a **custom-built quadcopter drone** controlled by an **ESP32 microcontroller**. The drone integrates an **MPU6050 IMU sensor** and **four ESCs** for motor control. The system is designed to run on **FreeRTOS**, with a **PID control algorithm** for real-time stabilization.  

The firmware will be programmed in **C++ using the Arduino framework**, and the ESP32 will be configured as a **Wi-Fi server** for remote monitoring and control.

## Features
- Custom-designed **PCB** connecting microcontroller, sensors, and motor controllers

## Planned Features
- Fully functional ESP32 firmware integrating real-time PID stabilization  
- Remote control via Wi-Fi interface   

## Current Status
- **Hardware assembly:** complete  
- **Firmware:** ESP32 programming in progress  
- **Wi-Fi server:** planned for remote control  

## Technologies
- **Microcontroller:** ESP32  
- **Programming:** C++ (Arduino framework)  
- **Real-Time OS:** FreeRTOS  
- **Control:** PID algorithm for flight stabilization  
- **Communication:** Wi-Fi server (planned)  
- **Motor control:** LEDC PWM channels  
- **Sensors:** MPU6050 IMU  

## Project Goals
- Gain hands-on experience with **embedded systems and real-time control**  
- Develop skills in **PCB design, motor control, and sensor integration**  
- Learn and apply **FreeRTOS task management and PID algorithms**  
- Create a platform for **future enhancements** in autonomous drone systems  

## Getting Started
This repository currently contains hardware design files. Once firmware development is complete, instructions for programming the ESP32 and running the drone will be added.
